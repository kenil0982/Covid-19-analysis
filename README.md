# Covid-19-analysis
# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data. The goal is to analyze trends, visualize key metrics, and derive actionable insights that could inform decision-making for public health and policy.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the development environment  
- **CSV** as the data source

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Analyze the spread of COVID-19 over time and across countries
- Identify countries with the highest case fatality rates
- Understand the relationship between testing, confirmed cases, and deaths
- Visualize trends through line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps

## 📈 Key Insights
- Countries with early testing had lower fatality rates
- Some regions showed spikes correlating with major events or policy shifts
- Visual patterns revealed second and third waves in various geographies

## 🔍 Sample Visuals
- Line chart showing daily new cases
- Heatmap of deaths per million population
- Bar chart comparing top 10 countries by recovery rate

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Add interactive dashboards (e.g., using Plotly or Power BI)
- Incorporate vaccination data for deeper analysis
- Use ML models for trend prediction (optional)
